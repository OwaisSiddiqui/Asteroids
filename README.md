# Installation
First `git clone https://github.com/OwaisSiddiqui/Asteroids`. Then run the `Main.java` in the `src` folder.

# Objective
The objective of the game is to earn as many points possible by destroying all the asteroids in each level. Higher levels have more asteroids.

# Instructions to Play
Use the *space bar* to shoot bullets and the *up, right, and left* keys to move forward, right, and left respectively.

# Collision Detection
The collision detection in this version of the game is not AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) like the original. It is a more acccurate collision detection called Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) collision detection.
